# Python_Projects

This repository will be for projects and assignments related to python
( as well as a small folder for notes and small bits of code ) 

Projects:

	* Phonebook
	* File Transfer Gui
	* Student Tracking Gui

Phonebook

	This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contacts name, phone number, and
	email address in a database that allows the user to udpate and delete previously stored entries

File Transfer Gui

	This project allows the user to move all files modified within the last 24 hours from a source folder,
	to a destination folder. It also provides the user a message stating which files were successfully
	transfered to their new location.

Student Tracking

	This assignment utilizes a gui for the user to enter their information into a database of 
	students. It also contains built in filters to avoid incorrect email formats, ensure duplicate 
	entries are not created, format the users first and last name this keeps 

Assignments:

	* Database
	* Polymorphism
	* sqlite3
	* Web Page Generator 
	* Nice or Mean game

Database

	This assignment provides an example of creating a small database with python and sqlite3.
	The program iterates through the files and provides the files ending with .txt extension

Polymorphism
	
	An example assignment of how to utilize polymorphism within python.
	Plus some fun Dungeons and Dragons vibes.

sqlite3

	This assignment is an examle of creating and connecting to a database through sqlite3, and querying that
	database for user information. Through with, for, and while statements, the program selects the information
	for users greater than the age of 30, stores it and prints it back to the user

	
Web Page generator

	This program brings up a gui for the user to instantly create a basic html page! The user can select from the 
	Default page, or create one with a title of their own. The program inserts either text into a html page, already complete
	with the html language and metacharset already written.

Nice or Mean game

	This quick game will state to the user if they have been mean, or nice depending on their actions. The program maintains a running
	total of user input in both 'mean' and 'nice' tallies. When either hits 3, the program will display an informative message to the 	user.
